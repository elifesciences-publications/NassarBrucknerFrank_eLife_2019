# NassarBrucknerFrank_eLife_2019
Analysis code for: Nassar, Bruckner, Frank (2019) eLife

All scripts are meant to be run in matlab and seem to work in versions 2016b and 2018a. 

Primary analysis code is in EEG_cannon_analysis_mastList_r1.m .

The primary analysis script relies on a number of additional subfunctions that are contained within the subfunctions folder. 

Running the script will require downloading the EEG data from Dryad (HERE) and the behavioral data from the nassar lab website: https://sites.brown.edu/mattlab/resources/ . 

If you have issues with the code let me know: matthew_nassar@brown.edu
